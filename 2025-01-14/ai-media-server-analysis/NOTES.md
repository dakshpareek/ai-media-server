# AI Media Server - Notes & Learnings

## Current Status Observations (2025-01-14 10:01 - Clean Working State)

### ✅ **Successfully Completed & Stable**
- Docker environment properly set up and running
- Environment configuration (.env) correctly customized for local system
- Directory structure created with proper permissions
- All core services deployed and running
- Network connectivity established between services
- **✅ qBittorrent fully configured and tested**
  - Credentials: admin / ai_media_2024 ✅ Working
  - Categories: movies, tv, music ✅ Configured
  - Download paths: /downloads with /downloads/incomplete ✅ Configured
  - API access: ✅ Verified and working

### 🔧 **Current Service Status**

#### **qBittorrent - ✅ FULLY CONFIGURED**
- **Status**: Healthy and running
- **URL**: http://localhost:8080
- **Credentials**: admin / ai_media_2024
- **Configuration**: Complete with categories and download paths
- **API**: Working and tested

#### **Other Services - Ready for Configuration**
- **Prowlarr**: http://localhost:9696 (indexer management)
- **Radarr**: http://localhost:7878 (movie management) 
- **Overseerr**: http://localhost:5055 (request management)

### 🎯 **Working Configuration State**

#### **What's Been Accomplished**
```
✅ Infrastructure: Docker, networking, volumes, permissions
✅ qBittorrent: Complete automated setup with credentials
✅ Service Orchestration: All containers running and healthy
✅ Download Management: Categories and paths configured
✅ API Integration: qBittorrent API tested and working
```

#### **Configuration Scripts Available**
- `scripts/configure-qbittorrent.sh` - ✅ Tested and working
- `scripts/configure-all-services.sh` - Master orchestration script
- Individual service scripts for Prowlarr, Radarr, Overseerr

### 🚀 **Next Steps (Manual Configuration)**

Since we have a stable base with qBittorrent working, the next steps involve configuring the remaining services:

#### **Step 1: Prowlarr Setup**
- Access: http://localhost:9696
- Configure indexers (1337x, YTS, EZTV)
- Extract API key for integration

#### **Step 2: Radarr Configuration**
- Access: http://localhost:7878  
- Set root folder: /media/movies
- Connect to qBittorrent download client
- Connect to Prowlarr for indexers

#### **Step 3: Overseerr Integration**
- Access: http://localhost:5055
- Connect to Radarr for movie management
- Set up user accounts and permissions

#### **Step 4: End-to-End Testing**
- Request a test movie through Overseerr
- Verify workflow: Overseerr → Radarr → Prowlarr → qBittorrent

### 💡 **Key Technical Insights from qBittorrent Success**

#### **What Worked Well**
- **API-based Configuration**: More reliable than file manipulation
- **Credential Management**: Automated setup with admin/ai_media_2024
- **Container Integration**: LinuxServer images work consistently
- **Validation Testing**: API endpoints confirm configuration success

#### **Best Practices Identified**
- Use temporary password extraction for initial authentication
- API-based configuration over file-based changes
- Validate each step with API calls
- Standardized credentials for development environment

### 🏆 **Achievement: Stable Foundation**

**qBittorrent Success**: We have successfully automated the most complex service (qBittorrent) which serves as the foundation for the entire download workflow. All other services will integrate with this working download client.

**Clean State**: System is in a stable, documented state ready for the next phase of configuration.

**Approach**: Moving forward with manual configuration for remaining services, using the proven patterns from qBittorrent success.

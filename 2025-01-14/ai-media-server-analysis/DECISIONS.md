# AI Media Server - Decision Log

## âœ… Current Agreed Decisions (Updated: 2025-01-14 15:30)

- **Architecture**: Docker-based microservices with VPN integration for indexer services
- **VPN Solution**: Gluetun-based NordVPN integration for Prowlarr and FlareSolverr
- **Network Strategy**: Shared VPN container with service networking for traffic routing
- **Security Approach**: Only indexer services (Prowlarr/FlareSolverr) through VPN, media services on local network
- **Service Integration**: Proven pattern with qBittorrent as foundation + VPN-protected indexers

## ðŸ“Œ Decision History

### ðŸ“… 2025-01-14 15:30 - **VPN INTEGRATION ANALYSIS & SOLUTION**
- **Challenge**: Current setup not working - bubuntux/nordvpn showing "No token set" error
- **Analysis**: User created dual VPN approaches with different containers
- **Solution**: Consolidate to single Gluetun-based VPN with proper NordVPN integration
- **Services**: Prowlarr + FlareSolverr through VPN, other services on local network
- **Benefits**: Prevents indexer blocking, maintains performance for media services

### ðŸ“… 2025-01-14 15:20 - **VPN REQUIREMENT IDENTIFIED**
- **Decision**: Implement NordVPN integration for Prowlarr and FlareSolverr
- **Reasoning**: Indexers getting blocked, need VPN protection for search/resolution services
- **Implementation**: Shared VPN container with network_mode service sharing
- **Credentials**: NordVPN email/password already configured in .env

### ðŸ“… 2025-01-14 10:01 - **REVERT TO CLEAN STATE**
- **Decision**: Revert to stable working state with qBittorrent fully configured
- **Reasoning**: Authentication automation attempts became complex; prioritize stable foundation
- **Cleaned Up**: Removed authentication automation scripts that were in development
- **Stable State**: qBittorrent (admin/ai_media_2024) fully working and tested
- **Next Phase**: Manual configuration of remaining services using proven patterns

### ðŸ“… 2025-01-14 11:20 - qBittorrent Automated Credentials âœ… SUCCESS
- **Decision**: Implement automated credential setup for qBittorrent
- **Reasoning**: Eliminate manual password extraction and configuration
- **Implementation**: API-based credential setting with admin/ai_media_2024
- **Result**: âœ… Fully working and tested
- **Impact**: Established foundation for download management

### ðŸ“… 2025-01-14 12:45 - API-Based Configuration âœ… PROVEN
- **Decision**: Use API-based configuration instead of file manipulation
- **Reasoning**: More reliable than direct config file editing
- **Implementation**: Direct API calls with extracted authentication keys
- **Result**: âœ… Successfully implemented for qBittorrent

### ðŸ“… 2025-01-14 10:15 - Docker-based Architecture âœ… STABLE
- **Decision**: Use Docker containerization with LinuxServer images
- **Reasoning**: Consistent deployment, easy management, proven reliability
- **Services**: Overseerr, Radarr, Prowlarr, qBittorrent, FileBrowser, Cloudflared
- **Result**: âœ… All services deployed and running

### ðŸ“… 2025-01-14 - Initial Analysis
- **Analysis**: Current system status evaluation completed
- **Services Status**: Core services deployed and running
- **Configuration**: Environment properly configured with local paths and user permissions
- **Network**: Docker network established with port mappings
- **Phase**: Ready for service configuration

### Previous Setup Decisions (from README analysis):
- **Media Automation**: Selected *arr suite (Radarr, Prowlarr) for automated media management
- **Download Client**: qBittorrent chosen for torrent handling âœ… CONFIGURED
- **Request Management**: Overseerr for user-friendly media requests
- **Containerization**: Docker Compose for service orchestration
- **Security**: Cloudflare tunnel for external access

### ðŸ“… 2025-01-14 16:00 - **ðŸŽ¯ BREAKTHROUGH: NordVPN ACCESS TOKEN METHOD**
- **Discovery**: User found NordVPN Access Token option in dashboard - "Advanced Settings" â†’ "Get Access Token"
- **Decision**: Switch from OpenVPN credentials to Access Token authentication
- **Implementation**: 
  - Updated docker-compose.yml: `OPENVPN_USER=token` + `OPENVPN_PASSWORD=${NORDVPN_TOKEN}`
  - Created token setup guide: `scripts/setup-nordvpn-token.sh`
  - Modern method - no separate username/password needed
- **Advantages**: 
  - Works with existing account credentials
  - NordVPN's preferred modern authentication
  - More secure than traditional OpenVPN credentials
  - No service credential generation required

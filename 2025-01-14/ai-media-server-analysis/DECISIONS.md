# AI Media Server - Decision Log

## âœ… Current Agreed Decisions (Updated: 2025-01-14 10:01)

- **Architecture**: Docker-based microservices with automated configuration
- **Configuration Approach**: API-based automation for complex services, manual for user preferences
- **qBittorrent**: Fully automated with API-based credential setup âœ… WORKING
- **Service Integration**: Proven pattern with qBittorrent as foundation
- **User Experience**: Stable foundation with manual configuration for remaining services

## ðŸ“Œ Decision History

### ðŸ“… 2025-01-14 10:01 - **REVERT TO CLEAN STATE**
- **Decision**: Revert to stable working state with qBittorrent fully configured
- **Reasoning**: Authentication automation attempts became complex; prioritize stable foundation
- **Cleaned Up**: Removed authentication automation scripts that were in development
- **Stable State**: qBittorrent (admin/ai_media_2024) fully working and tested
- **Next Phase**: Manual configuration of remaining services using proven patterns

### ðŸ“… 2025-01-14 11:20 - qBittorrent Automated Credentials âœ… SUCCESS
- **Decision**: Implement automated credential setup for qBittorrent
- **Reasoning**: Eliminate manual password extraction and configuration
- **Implementation**: API-based credential setting with admin/ai_media_2024
- **Result**: âœ… Fully working and tested
- **Impact**: Established foundation for download management

### ðŸ“… 2025-01-14 12:45 - API-Based Configuration âœ… PROVEN
- **Decision**: Use API-based configuration instead of file manipulation
- **Reasoning**: More reliable than direct config file editing
- **Implementation**: Direct API calls with extracted authentication keys
- **Result**: âœ… Successfully implemented for qBittorrent

### ðŸ“… 2025-01-14 10:15 - Docker-based Architecture âœ… STABLE
- **Decision**: Use Docker containerization with LinuxServer images
- **Reasoning**: Consistent deployment, easy management, proven reliability
- **Services**: Overseerr, Radarr, Prowlarr, qBittorrent, FileBrowser, Cloudflared
- **Result**: âœ… All services deployed and running

### ðŸ“… 2025-01-14 - Initial Analysis
- **Analysis**: Current system status evaluation completed
- **Services Status**: Core services deployed and running
- **Configuration**: Environment properly configured with local paths and user permissions
- **Network**: Docker network established with port mappings
- **Phase**: Ready for service configuration

### Previous Setup Decisions (from README analysis):
- **Media Automation**: Selected *arr suite (Radarr, Prowlarr) for automated media management
- **Download Client**: qBittorrent chosen for torrent handling âœ… CONFIGURED
- **Request Management**: Overseerr for user-friendly media requests
- **Containerization**: Docker Compose for service orchestration
- **Security**: Cloudflare tunnel for external access
